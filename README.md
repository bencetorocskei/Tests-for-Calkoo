# Tests-for-Calkoo


My task was to document test cases for a VAT Calculator page (https://www.calkoo.com/en/vat-calculator) 
and bugs if encounter any. And choose at least two cases to automatize.

I chose googlesheets for the manual test case writing. 
And created the test scenarios following the requirements. Each scenario is on a different sheet, color blue.
On those sheets you find the function relevant testcases.
There is one sheet for the Bug Reports and one for for the questions and remarks if I have any.

For test automation I created a Maven POM Java project. I used JUnit for testcase writing and Selenium Webdriver for browser automation.
